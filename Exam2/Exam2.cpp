int main()
{
    //1) declare a type float called fltOne (2)


    //2) declare a type float called fltTwo (2)


    //3) declare a type float called fltThree (2)


    //4) declare type string called stringOne (2)


    //5) assign fltOne the value of 3 (2)


    //6) assign fltTwo the value of 5 (2)


    //7) assign stringOne the value of "hello"  (2)


    //8) use the multiplication operator to multiply fltOne with fltTwo 
    //use fltThree to store the result (3)


    //9) increment fltThree  (3)


    //10) initialise a type char called myChar to the value 'b' (2)


    //11) output the value fltThree and myChar to the screen  (3)


    //12) declare a variable of type int called myValue  (3)


    //13)  prompt the user to provide an input to myValue (2)    


    //14) after prompting, get a variable from the user of type int called myValue. (3) 


    //15) take the input and apply a decision based on the number inputted . 
    //The decision should be based on if the user inputs a number below 100 
    //the code should output "below 100" (8)


    //16) create an array of type int with 12 elements called arrayOfInts (8)


    //17 part a) create a for loop to iterate through the above array and populate the array with 
    //{0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27} 
    //(6 marks)


    //17 part b) create a for loop to iterate through the above array and output its contents
    //ensure each number is shown on the same line, but a space separates them all (6 marks)


    //18) initialise a variable of type int called cost to 200 (2) 


    //19) create a pointer pointing to the above variable called costPtr (4) 


    //20) create a function which calculates an increase of a given percentage (13)
    // 
    //The function should be declared in the correct file and defined in the correct file
    //the function should take a cost parameter and a percentage parameter
    //it should return the cost plus the percentage increas. 
    //For example if the paramenters are cost = 100 and percentage = 50, it should return 150. 
    //For another example, if the parameters are cost = 50 and percentage = 10, it should return 55.
    //the function requires to take two type floats as parameters and return type float    
    //test the function here:


    //21) using the below string
    string s1 = "Hello, World!";      
    //using a string method, create two separate strings from the above called s2 and s3 (5) 
    //s2 must equal "Hello," which must be taken from s1
    //s3 must equal "World!" which must be taken from s1


    //22) using a string method, calculate the length of the s1 string and 
    //assign to lengthFG. Output the value to the console (5) 
    int lengthFG;



    //23) use a string method to compare  s2 and s3(5) 
    //if the strings are "equal" according to the string method, they should output "strings equal"
    //because we can see that they are not equal, "strings equal" should not be outputted. 


    //24) using a different string method to what you have used in above code
    // remove the "!" character from the end of the string s3 . Output the s3 to confirm.  (5)
